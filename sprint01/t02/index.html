    <td>The Soul Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a
        singularity that predates the universe. For some time, it was kept
        on the planet Vormir under the watchful eye of the Red Skull, before
        Thanos came to the planet in search of it and had to tragically
        sacrifice his beloved daughter Gamora to obtain it.</td>

    <td>The Time Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnants of
        singularities that predated the universe. It had the ability to
        manipulate time, even in places "beyond" time, such as the Dark
        Dimension. It was contained inside the Eye of Agamotto under the
        protection of the Masters of the Mystic Arts, who swore to protect
        it. Doctor Strange came across the relic in Wong's library and used
        it to force a bargain with Dormammu.</td>

            The Space Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a
            singularity that predated the universe, which represented the
            element of space. Housed within the Tesseract, over the course of
            history it was wielded by many individuals, including Johann Schmidt
            of HYDRA, Mar-Vell of the Kree Empire, the Skrulls, and Loki of
            Asgard. During the Infinity War, the Tesseract was shattered by
            Thanos, who put the Space Stone inside his Infinity Gauntlet.

            The Mind Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a
            singularity that predated the universe, which governed over the
            fabric of mind. It was previously wielded by Loki inside his Scepter
            who received it as a gift from Thanos for the Chitauri Invasion.
            After the Battle of New York, the Scepter was confiscated by HYDRA,
            whose scientists used it to give extraordinary powers to the twins
            Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. After the fall of HYDRA, the Scepter was
            recovered by the Avengers.

            (pronounced ēTHər), the Dark Elves and their leader Malekith
            intended to use it to bring eternal darkness upon all of the Nine
            Realms. Taken from the Elves by the Asgardians, it was later
            entrusted to the Collector following the conclusion of the Second
            Dark Elf Conflict.
