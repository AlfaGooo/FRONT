    <p>Deadpool is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
    Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist/writer Rob Liefeld, the character first appeared in 
    The New Mutants #98 (cover-dated February 1991). <b>Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain</b>
    when he made his first appearance in The New Mutants and later in issues of X-Force, but later evolved 
    into his more recognizable antiheroic persona.<br><br>Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Winston Wilson, is a 
    disfigured mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. 
    The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, 
    including breaking the fourth wall for humorous effect and running gags.

    <p>The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media.  
    In the 2004 series Cable & Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred appearance 
    as "Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar-Pei" (though in the comic, Reynolds' name 
    is misspelled as "Renolds".)[6][7] Reynolds himself would eventually portray the 
    character in the X-Men film series, appearing in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), 
    Deadpool (2016), and its sequel Deadpool 2 (2018).[8][9][10] Reynolds attributes 
    Cable & Deadpool #2 to what got him hooked on the character and inspired him to bring 
    the character to the movies. [11] He is slated to continue playing the character in 
    the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[12]</p>
